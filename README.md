## Description
Hire Me bridges the gap between people hiring out products and people seeking to hire products. Our site requires people hiring out products to sign up and verify their information to ensure that the clients 'people seeking to hire' hire from credible sources. People seeking to hire need no signing up as the contact information of people hiring out the product is already indicated. It is our vision to push this website to many users so that we may upgrade to more products and improve overall.
## Design
The web was designed using Figma and is open for veiwing by anyone [here](https://www.figma.com/file/DqtT43ieWrlMV2Gb6Qi8Cq/hire-me?node-id=102%3A2).
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Harp on to your prefered browser,
* Type in the web url,
* If you are seeking to hire, scroll on the available categories,
* Contact the hiring out party,
* Rate the experience you had when business is done.
* If you are hiring out products,
* sign up and undergo the vigorous validation process,
* Post your ads by clicking the buttons and posting.
For demonstration purposes, since github does not support PHP, we opted for local storage. The web is independent and does not depend on outer sources to fully run.
## Known Bugs
The web currently runs smoothly with no hitches. Incase any bugs arise, our very able team will look into it and have it sorted!
## Technologies Used
The project was created entilely using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. In the future we hope to improve it and incorporate other programming languages to make the user experience even better.
## Support and contact details
Incase you run into any issue or need any clarification, contact the project's scrum master via [email](mailto:geoffrey.githinji@student.moringaschool.com). If you would also like to contribute to the project, contact the scrum master via the same email.
